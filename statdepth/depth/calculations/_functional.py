    Calculate the band depth for a set of functional curves.

    Band depth is an order statistic for functional data (see `fboxplot`), with
    a higher band depth indicating larger "centrality".  In analog to scalar
    data, the functional curve with highest band depth is called the median
    curve, and the band made up from the first N/2 of N curves is the 50%
    central region.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    data : list of DataFrames
        Functions to calculate band depth from
    to_compute: list of DataFrame, DataFrame, or pd.Index
        Data to compute depths of. If None, compute depth of all samples. 
    J: int (default=2)
        J parameter in the band depth calculation. J=3 can be computationally expensive for large datasets, and also does not have a closed form solution. 
    containment: Callable or string (default='r2')
        Defines what containment means for the dataset. For functions from R-->R, we use the standard ordering on R. For higher dimensional spaces, we implement a simplex method. 
        A full list can be found in the README, as well as instructions on passing a custom definition for containment.  
    relax: bool
        If True, use a strict definition of containment, else use containment defined by the proportion of time the curve is in the band. 
    deep_check: bool (default=False)
        If True, perform a more extensive error checking routine. Optional because it can be computationally expensive for large datasets. 

    Returns:
    ----------
    pd.Series, pd.DataFrame: Depth values for each function.
